Daily Journal
Final Checkpoint
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I have finished most of my server at this point. I am only failing 2 of the no-auth portions and i have no clue how to fix it. I have tried multiple different ways and end up failing more of the tests. I'm going to stop working on my server and begin working on my client side. The application hasn't been too difficult so far, the largest time consuming problem was my database not working and me not knowing why which took 4 hours to solve. It made me very angry that there was nothing wrong and I had to make a new database to solve the issue.
