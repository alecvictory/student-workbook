## Daily Journal

Daily Journal
Final Checkpoint
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I've been working on my client side all day and haven't ran into any major issues. One thing that i've noticed is i've fallen out of practive with vue in the 3 weeks that i haven't touched it. this is an awesome reminder that I need to code every day once i graduate the course so that I can keep in practice and not fall out.
