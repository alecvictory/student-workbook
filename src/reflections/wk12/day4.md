Daily Journal
Final Checkpoint
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I finished the application today. It was intense and difficult, I walked into class this morning feeling terrible because I wasn't as far along as i thought i would be and stuff didn't seem to work. After getting graded and having some direction be given to me I started to knock out alot of the requirements which made me feel much better. It was amazing how the application turned around and I met so many of the requirements. I finished it on the third grading in the early afternoon. Its hard to believe 13 weeks ago I knew almost nothing about software development and now i can build a functioning full stack application by myself. It feels amazing all the hard work that i've put in up to this point.
