Final Checkpoint
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

I have been struggling all day with functionality. The biggest mistakes i've been making is syntax errors which is extremely annoying. I like to think of myself as somebody who has high attention to detail but i keep on missing an "S". Me and justin have a running tally and its at 3 right now. One thing that has been bugging me most of the night is the many to many relationship on the front end and how i'm going to call on it and display them. I've been trying to get my vaultkeeps to display for the last 3 hours and haven't had any luck.
