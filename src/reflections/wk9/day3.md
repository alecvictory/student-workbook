How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

small teams can expand their scope of communication such as utilizing slack more often. this makes it so that you can communicate more effectively and not need to waste manpower or time during meetings.

Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

because if 2 sprints cant run in parallel with each other then they would have to choose between work development or application priority

What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

Good service Cheap won't be Fast

Good service Fast won't be Cheap

Fast service Cheap won't be Good

the purpose is to understand the tradeoffs of each service. The first is that there is good service and its cheap but it wont be fast. its understanding that you will have quality work, its cheap, but you wont get it quickly.
