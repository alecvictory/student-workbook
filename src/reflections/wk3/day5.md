Daily Journal
Weekly Reflections (Optional)
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week was an extreme struggle for me. There were points where I understood what was happening but most of the time I felt lost. Usually by the end of the week I would fundamentally understand what was happening and I would feel confident for the upcoming checkpoint. This week I felt dazed and confused. This checkpoint was a struggle for me.
