Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide and answer the following questions

1 - What is the purpose of wire-framing?

wire-framing is a 2 dimensional system used to build out an initial product of a website. This is done before all of the programming and coding so everyone can agree where everything is placed.

2 - What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low fidelity wire frames - the cheapest wire frame and serves as a starting point or a trial and error process 
mid fidelity wire frames - the most common, a more accurate representation of a product with more detail than low fidelity
high fidelity wire frames - should be saved for late in the project, specific layouts with high detail


3 - Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

yes, wire-frames are important to know what the consumer has in mind or how they want the product developed. As the project continues its important to add detail so the consumer can decide where they want stuff placed.
