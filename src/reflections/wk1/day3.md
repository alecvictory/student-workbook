## Daily Journal


Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Cheating At Design and answer the following questions.

1 - What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Not increasing size of text when developing a hierarchy but changing the darkness itself.

2 - Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp
https://bootstrapmade.com/ // A resource that shows bootstrap templates
https://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/ // a resource that shows web designs for inspiration

3 - How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Good design can help the flow of the website. If the website is too cluttered you wouldn't want to read it or have trouble finding information that you're looking for. You can convey hierarchy of importance by using darker text to show it being more important. You can also remove borders so its less cluttered and use border shading instead. You can also use colors to make selection choices less bland and also convey higher levels of importance or price depending on how you design the site.
