1- In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git is important because there are multiple developers working on a project. Git is used so there arent any conflicts, and if the code breaks the developers can return to an older version of the code thats working.

2- What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

The benefits of having multiple branches is so  multiple developers can work on the same project and be able to make commits in parallel. These commits are also beneficial for testing without breaking the final product.

Git is a local repository whereas GitHub is server based.
