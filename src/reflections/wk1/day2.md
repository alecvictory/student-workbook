Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > CSS and answer the following questions

1 - What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use.

Pseudo-class is a key word added to a certain element that specifies a special state. I believe the primary one that will be used is :hover and some less common ones will be :after and :before.

2- What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a system built into CSS that determines which rule will be applied when there are multiple rules targeting the same element and property.

3- What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

if you over-utilize the !important feature it will cause problems with CSS's specificity. Also, it will overwrite any features causing accessibility issues for other developers.
