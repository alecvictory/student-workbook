Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions
Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

pair programming

What went well?

the paired programming was effective, my partner and I were strong in areas and weak in others so we complimented each other well and were able to create a great product.

What would you do differently?

I would've spent significantly more time planning the project out. We ran into issues later down the road that could've been prevented if we had thought of it ahead of time.
