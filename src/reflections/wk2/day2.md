# Day 2 JavaScript Functions, Objects, and Loops

## Daily Journal

Afternoon Challenge - https://alecvictory.github.io/js-tests-loops-and-arrays/

Read Intro to JS > JavaScript Functions and answer the following questions

1 - What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

let var = function() - you let a variable equate to a function then enact the entire function

function var() = {} - the function var set within paramaters is equal to the entire var

function var() = () => {}

2 - What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
parameter - are used when defining a function, the names created within the function

argument - values that the function recieves from parameters when function is invoked

3 - What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

a function that accepts and/or returns another function

function greaterThan (n) {
    return => m > n;
}
let greaterThan 100 = GreaterThan 100
