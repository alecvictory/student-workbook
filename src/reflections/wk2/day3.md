Afternoon Challenge - https://alecvictory.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

Read Intro to JS > Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions

1 - What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log - you can use this to print functions into the console to see how the function runs

you can also physically type into the console to view your changes

2 - Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

the sources tab. this can be useful because it shows where the error is and you can make changes in the sources tab and refresh to the page to see if the edits work

3 - Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

by using the debugger function. the debugger function goes line by line action by action so you can see how the code is running.
